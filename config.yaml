options:
  dockerhub-mirror:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The URL to the private docker registry configured as the dockerhub mirror to be used by the
      runners. If set a message will be displayed prior to job execution on self-hosted runner
      informing users to use the provided registry. You must use https:// as the protocol.
  openstack-clouds-yaml:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The clouds.yaml yaml necessary for OpenStack integration.
      The format for the clouds.yaml is described in the docs:
      (https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/configuration/index.html#clouds-yaml).
  openstack-flavor:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      The openstack flavor to use to spawn virtual machines. This controls the hardware resource
      of the virtual machines. See docs for details:
      (https://docs.openstack.org/nova/rocky/user/flavors.html).
  openstack-network:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      The openstack network for virtual machines hosting the runners. The network must allow this
      application to be able to access the virtual machine though the IP assigned by the openstack
      network. See docs for details:
      (https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/intro-os-networking.html).
  experimental-use-aproxy:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >-
      (Experimental, may be removed) When set to true, aproxy (https://github.com/canonical/aproxy)
      will be installed within the runners. It will forward all HTTP(S) traffic to standard ports
      (80, 443) to a proxy server configured by the juju model config 'juju-http-proxy'
      (or, if this is not set, 'juju-https-proxy' will be used).
      This is useful when the charm is deployed in a network that requires a proxy to access the
      internet.
      Note that you should not specify a proxy server listening on port 80 or 443, as all traffic
      to these ports is relayed to aproxy, which would cause an infinite loop.
  group:
    type: string
    default: "default"
    description: >-
      The organization runner group to register the self-hosted runner under. This has no effect on
      runners under a repository.
  labels:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      Additional comma separated labels to attach to self-hosted runners. By default, the labels
      "self-hosted", architecture (i.e. "x64", "arm64"), os (i.e. "linux"), os-flavor (i.e. 
      "jammy") are set. Any labels provided via this configuration will be appended to the default 
      values.
  path:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The organization or the repository to register the self-hosted runners. For organization the
      path would be the name of the organization. For repository the path should be in the
      "{owner}/{repo}" format.
  reconcile-interval:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: >-
      Minutes between each reconciliation of the current runners state and their targeted state.
      On reconciliation, the charm polls the state of runners and see if actions are needed. A
      random delay of 25% is added. Changes to this time interval will apply when next interval is
      triggered. Prior to reconciliation, any packages, and services used by the software will be
      updated.
  repo-policy-compliance-token:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The token to authenticate with the repository-policy-compliance service in order to
      generate one-time-tokens. This option requires the repo-policy-compliance-url to be set.
      If not set, the repository-policy-compliance service will not be used.
  repo-policy-compliance-url:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The URL to the repository-policy-compliance service. This option requires the
      repo-policy-compliance-token to be set. If not set, the repository-policy-compliance service
      will not be used. This option is only supported when using OpenStack Cloud.
  test-mode:
    type: string
    description: >-
      When set to 'insecure', the charm test mode is activated, which may deactivate some security
      hardening measures.
  token:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The GitHub Personal Access Token for registering the self-hosted runners. The token requires
      'repo' scope for repository runners and 'repo' + 'admin:org' scope for organization runners.
      For fine grained token scopes, see
      https://charmhub.io/github-runner/docs/how-to-change-token.
  virtual-machines:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: >-
      The number of virtual machine runners. This charm will spawn or destroy virtual machines
      runners to match this setting.

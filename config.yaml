options:
  denylist:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      A comma separated list of IPv4 networks in CIDR notation that runners can not access.
      The runner will always have access to essential services such as DHCP and DNS regardless
      of the denylist configuration.
  dockerhub-mirror:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      The private docker registry configured as dockerhub mirror to be used by the runners. If set 
      a message will be displayed prior to job execution on self-hosted runner informing users to 
      use the provided registry.
  experimental-openstack-clouds-yaml:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      (Experimental, under development) The openstack clouds.yaml
      (https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/configuration/index.html#clouds-yaml).
      Setting the openstack-clouds-yaml would enable spawning runners on OpenStack, instead of LXD
      vms. This feature is not yet ready and is under development.
  experimental-use-aproxy:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      (Experimental, may be removed) When set to true, aproxy (https://github.com/canonical/aproxy)
      will be installed within the runners. It will forward all HTTP(S) traffic to standard ports 
      (80, 443) to a proxy server configured by the juju model config 'juju-http-proxy' 
      (or, if this is not set, 'juju-https-proxy' will be used).
      This is useful when the charm is deployed in a network that requires a proxy to access the 
      internet.
      Note that you should not specify a proxy server listening on port 80 or 443, as all traffic
      to these ports is relayed to aproxy, which would cause an infinite loop.
  group:
    type: string
    default: "default"
    description: |
      The organization runner group to register the self-hosted runner under. This has no effect on
      runners under a repository.
  path:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      The organization or the repository to register the self-hosted runners. For organization the 
      path would be the name of the organization. For repository the path should be in the 
      "{owner}/{repo}" format.
  reconcile-interval:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Minutes between each reconciliation of the current runners state and their targeted state. 
      On reconciliation, the charm polls the state of runners and see if actions are needed. A 
      random delay of 25% is added. Changes to this time interval will apply when next interval is 
      triggered. Prior to reconciliation, any packages, and services used by the software will be 
      updated.
  runner-storage:
    type: string
    default: "juju-storage"
    description: |
      The storage for runner LXD instance to mount as disk. Can be "memory" or "juju-storage". If 
      set to "memory", memory-based storage created with tmpfs will be used as disk for LXD 
      instances. If set to "juju-storage", storage provided by juju will be used as disk for LXD 
      instances. This configuration cannot be changed after deployment. The charm needs to be
      redeployed to change the storage option.
  test-mode:
    type: string
    description: |
      When set to 'insecure', the charm test mode is activated, which may deactivate some security
      hardening measures.
  token:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
     The GitHub Personal Access Token for registering the self-hosted runners. The token requires
      'repo' scope for repository runners and 'repo' + 'admin:org' scope for organization runners.
  virtual-machines:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      The number of virtual machine runners. This charm will spawn or destroy virtual machines
      runners to match this setting.
  vm-cpu:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      The number of CPUs used per virtual machine runner.
  vm-memory:
    type: string
    default: 7GiB
    description: |
      Amount of memory to allocate per virtual machine runner. Positive integers with KiB, MiB, GiB,
      TiB, PiB, EiB suffix.
  vm-disk:
    type: string
    default: 10GiB
    description: |
      Amount of disk space to allocate to root disk for virtual machine runner. Positive integers
      with KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB suffix.

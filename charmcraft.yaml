summary: Creates a group of self-hosted github runners.
description: |
  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) managing
  [self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).

  Each unit of this charm will start a configurable number of virtual machines to host
  self-hosted runners. Each runner performs only one job, after which it unregisters from GitHub to 
  ensure that each job runs in a clean environment. The charm will periodically check the number of 
  runners and spawn or destroy them as necessary to maintain the configured number of runners. Both 
  the reconciliation interval and the number of runners to maintain are configurable.

    type: filesystem
    location: /storage/juju

actions:
  check-runners:
    description: Get info on active and registered runners
  flush-runners:
    description: Clear out all runners and start a new set

config:
  dockerhub-mirror:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The URL to the private docker registry configured as the dockerhub mirror to be used by the
      runners. If set a message will be displayed prior to job execution on self-hosted runner
      informing users to use the provided registry. You must use https:// as the protocol.
  openstack-clouds-yaml:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The clouds.yaml yaml necessary for OpenStack integration.
      The format for the clouds.yaml is described in the docs:
      (https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/configuration/index.html#clouds-yaml).
  openstack-flavor:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      (Deprecated, use flavor-label-list instead)
      The openstack flavor to use to spawn virtual machines. This controls the hardware resource
      of the virtual machines. See docs for details:
      (https://docs.openstack.org/nova/rocky/user/flavors.html).
  openstack-network:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      The openstack network for virtual machines hosting the runners. The network must allow this
      application to be able to access the virtual machine though the IP assigned by the openstack
      network. See docs for details:
      (https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/intro-os-networking.html).
  experimental-use-aproxy:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >-
      (Experimental, may be removed) When set to true, aproxy (https://github.com/canonical/aproxy)
      will be installed within the runners. It will forward TCP traffic matching the 'aproxy-exclude-addresses'
      and 'aproxy-redirect-ports' settings to a proxy server configured by the Juju model config 'juju-http-proxy'
      (or, if this is not set, 'juju-https-proxy' will be used).
      This is useful when the charm is deployed in a network that requires a proxy to access the
      internet.
      Note that you should carefully choose values for the 'aproxy-exclude-addresses' and
      'aproxy-redirect-ports' so that the network traffic from the runner to the HTTP proxy is not 
      captured by aproxy. The simplest way to achieve this is to add the IP address of the HTTP proxy 
      to 'aproxy-exclude-addresses' or exclude the HTTP proxy port from 'aproxy-redirect-ports'.
  aproxy-exclude-addresses:
    type: string
    default: "10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16"
    description: >-
      A comma-separated list of IP addresses that should be excluded from redirection to aproxy.
      127.0.0.0/8 are always excluded so you can omit if from the configuration.
  aproxy-redirect-ports:
    type: string
    default: "80, 443"
    description: >-
      A comma-separated list of ports or port ranges that should be redirected to aproxy.
  group:
    type: string
    default: "default"
    description: >-
      The organization runner group to register the self-hosted runner under. This has no effect on
      runners under a repository.
  labels:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      Additional comma separated labels to attach to self-hosted runners. By default, the labels
      "self-hosted", architecture (i.e. "x64", "arm64"), os (i.e. "linux"), os-flavor (i.e. 
      "jammy") are set. Any labels provided via this configuration will be appended to the default 
      values.
  path:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The organization or the repository to register the self-hosted runners. For organization the
      path would be the name of the organization. For repository the path should be in the
      "{owner}/{repo}" format.
  reconcile-interval:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: >-
      Minutes between each reconciliation of the current runners state and their targeted state.
      On reconciliation, the charm polls the state of runners and see if actions are needed. The
      value should be kept low, unless Github API rate limiting is encountered.
  repo-policy-compliance-token:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The token to authenticate with the repository-policy-compliance service in order to
      generate one-time-tokens. This option requires the repo-policy-compliance-url to be set.
      If not set, the repository-policy-compliance service will not be used.
  repo-policy-compliance-url:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The URL to the repository-policy-compliance service. This option requires the
      repo-policy-compliance-token to be set. If not set, the repository-policy-compliance service
      will not be used. This option is only supported when using OpenStack Cloud.
  test-mode:
    type: string
    description: >-
      When set to 'insecure', the charm test mode is activated, which may deactivate some security
      hardening measures.
  token:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The GitHub Personal Access Token for registering the self-hosted runners. The token requires
      'repo' scope for repository runners and 'repo' + 'admin:org' scope for organization runners.
      For fine grained token scopes, see
      https://charmhub.io/github-runner/docs/how-to-change-token.
  virtual-machines:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: >-
      (Deprecated, use base-virtual-machines or max-total-virtual-machines instead)
      The number of virtual machine runners. This charm will spawn or destroy virtual machines
      runners to match this setting. Setting virtual-machines to non-zero and any of
      base-virtual-machines or max-total-virtual-machines will block the charm.
  base-virtual-machines:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: >-
      The number of non-reactive virtual machine runners spawned by the charm per each
      combination of flavor and base. Currently, if the charm is integrated with MongoDB
      this config option will be ignored.
  max-total-virtual-machines:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: >-
      If the github-runner charm is integrated with MongoDB, the reactive mode will not spawn
      new virtual machines if there are max-total-virtual-machines of more virtual machines
      managed by the charm.
  flavor-label-combinations:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      List of "flavor:label" entries separated by ",". The flavor will correspond to a OpenStack
      flavor and the label will be a label for the GitHub runner. Only one flavor-label combination
      is supported at the moment. A valid configuration looks like "m1.small:small".
  manager-ssh-proxy-command:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      Optional ProxyCommand used by the ssh connection which is used to access the virtual
      machine runners from the runner manager. It is equivalent to ProxyCommand in ssh-config,
      but without a shell. For example, a value could be something like:
      `bash -c "openssl s_client -quiet -connect 192.168.20.2:2222 -servername %h 2> /dev/null"`
  pre-job-script:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Optional script (needs shebang) to execute in the pre-job phase of a spawned runner VM. 
      This can e.g. be useful for specific infrastructure related configurations 
      (e.g. usage of certain proxies or custom routes).
      Note that the user executing the script is the ubuntu user (which has sudo rights).
      Example script:
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      cat > ~/.ssh/config <<EOF
      host github.com
          user git
          hostname github.com
          port 22
          proxycommand socat - PROXY:squid.internal:%h:%p,proxyport=3128
      EOF
  runner-http-proxy:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The HTTP proxy value to use for the runners. If not specified, the model configuration option
      juju-http-proxy will be used instead.
  use-runner-proxy-for-tmate:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >-
      When set to true, the ssh connection from the runner to the tmate-ssh-server will be done
      using the proxy for the runner.
  runner-manager-log-level:
    type: string
    default: "INFO"
    description: >-
      The log level for the runner manager application. The value can be CRITICAL, FATAL, ERROR,
      WARNING, INFO, or DEBUG.

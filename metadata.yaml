  Creates a cluster of self-hosted github runners
summary: |
  This charm creates self-hosted GitHub runners. Each unit of this charm will start
  a configurable number of LXD based containers and virtual machines to host GitHub
  runners. Each runner performs only one job, after which it unregisters from GitHub
  to ensure that each job runs in a clean environment.

  The charm will periodically check the number of idle runners and spawn or destroy
  runners as necessary to maintain the configured number of runners. Both the reconciliation
  interval and the number of runners to maintain are configurable.

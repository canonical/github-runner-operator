summary: Creates a group of self-hosted github runners.
description: |
  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) managing
  [self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).

  Each unit of this charm will start a configurable number of LXD based virtual machines to host
  self-hosted runners. Each runner performs only one job, after which it unregisters from GitHub to 
  ensure that each job runs in a clean environment. The charm will periodically check the number of 
  runners and spawn or destroy them as necessary to maintain the configured number of runners. Both 
  the reconciliation interval and the number of runners to maintain are configurable.

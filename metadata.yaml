summary: Creates a cluster of self-hosted github runners.
description: |
  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) deploying
  self-hosted GitHub runners.

  Each unit of this charm will start a configurable number of LXD based virtual machines to host
  them. Each runner performs only one job, after which it unregisters from GitHub to ensure that
  each job runs in a clean environment. The charm will periodically check the number of idle runners
  and spawn or destroy them as necessary to maintain the configured number of runners. Both the
  reconciliation interval and the number of runners to maintain are configurable.

    Explanation:
     In reactive mode we use a separate process to spawn the runner, the server might be
     ACTIVE but the runner process is not running yet. We therefore check for the existence
     of the runner-installed.timestamp and assume the runner to be healthy if it does
     does not exist. This is a temporary solution until we have a better way to check
     the runner process, as there might still be a race condition (between writing the
     timestamp and actually starting the runner) that could cause the runner to be marked
     as unhealthy.

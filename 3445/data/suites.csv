    This is a full test for the happy path of the jobmanager.

    A fake http server will simulate all interactions with the jobmanager.

    The main steps in this test are:
     1. Change config to spawn a runner.
     2. The github-runner manager will register a runner on the jobmanager.
     3. The jobmanager will return a health response with ""PENDING"" status and not deletable.
     4. A tunnel will be prepared in the test so the reactive runner can get to the jobmanager.
        This is specific to this test and in production it should not be needed.
     5. After some time, the runner will hit the jobmanager health endpoint indicating
        IDLE status.
     6. The jobmanager will change the health response to ""IN_PROGRESS"" and will send a job
        to the builder-agent. The job will be a sleep 30 seconds.
     7. The builder-agent will run the job. While running the job it will send the status
        EXECUTING and after it is finished it will send the status FINISHED.
     8. Run reconcile in the github-runner manager. As the jobmanager fake health response is
        still ""IN_PROGRESS"" and not deletable, the runner should not be deleted.
     9. Change the health response from the fake jobmanager to reply COMPLETED and deletable.
     10. Run reconcile in the github-runner manager. The runner should be deleted at this point.

    Test reactive mode together with jobmanager.

    Test that after putting a job in the queue that the runner is registered and the
    job is picked up.

    So,
    1. Put job in the queue
    2. Wait for runner to be registered
    3. Wait for reactive process to ask for job status
    4. Mark job deletable
    5. Reconcile
    6. Assert queue is empty

    This is a full test for the happy path of the jobmanager.

    A message is created that will target the jobmamanager. A fake http server will
    simulate all interactions with the jobmanager. The main steps in this test are:
     1. Create a job and put it in mongodb.
     2. The jobmanager will reply to the github-runner manager that the job is ""PENDING""
     3. The github-runner manager will get a token from the jobmanager for the runner and
        will spawn a reactive runner with this token.
     4. A tunnel will be prepared in the test so the reactive runner can get to the jobmanager.
        This is specific to this test and in production it should not be needed.
     5. After some time, the reactive runner will hit the jobmanager health endpoint indicating
        IDLE status.
     6. The jobmanager will change the health response to ""IN_PROGRESS"" and will send a job
        to the builder-agent. The job will be a sleep 30 seconds.
     7. The builder-agent will run the the job. While running the job it will send the status
        EXECUTING and after it is finished it will send the status FINISHED.
     8. Run reconcile in the github-runner manager. As the jobmanager fake health response is
        still ""IN_PROGRESS"" and not deletable, the runner should not be deleted.
     9. Change the health response from the fake jobmanager to reply COMPLETED and deletable.
     10. Run reconcile in the github-runner manager. The runner should be deleted at this point.
         The mongodb should be empty.

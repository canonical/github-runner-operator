A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) for deploying and managing [GitHub self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) on virtual machines.

This charm simplifies the initial deployment and "day N" operations of GitHub self-hosted runners. The charm makes it easy to manage self-hosted runners with security and hardware resource usage in mind.

Operating a self-hosted runner comes with [certain security concerns according to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security).
Just like GitHub's, the self-hosted runners managed by the charm are isolated in a single-use virtual machine.

Some of the charm dependencies upgrades on a schedule to migrate security risks. The landscape-client charm can be deployed with this charm to ensure other dependencies are up to date.

The charm maintains a set of ephemeral self-hosted runners, each isolated in a single-use virtual machine instance. In addition, resource limits for the self-hosted runners can be configured.

See [charm architecture](https://charmhub.io/github-runner/docs/charm-architecture) for more information.

The charm also supports observability through the optional `cos-agent` integration.
Metrics and logs about the runners and the charm itself are collected and sent to the [Canonical Observability Stack](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack) for analysis and visualisation.

This charm will make operating GitHub self-hosted runners simple and straightforward for DevOps or SRE teams through Juju's clean interface.

The charm enforces a set of GitHub repository settings as best practice. This is planned to be opt-in in the future. See [How to comply with repository policies](https://charmhub.io/github-runner/docs/repo-policy).

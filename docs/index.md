# GitHub Runner Operator

A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) for deploying and managing [GitHub self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) on virtual machines. The charm maintains a set of self-hosted runners, each isolated in a single-use virtual machine instance. 

Like any Juju charm, this charm supports one-line deployment, configuration, integration, scaling, and more. 
For the github-runner-operator charm, this includes:
* Stateless operation.
* Configurable resource limits.
* Ability to redeploy without losing any data (no need to back up).
* Supported observability through the `cos-agent` integration.
* Scheduled dependences upgrades to mitigate security risks. Furthermore, the landscape-client charm can be deployed with this charm to ensure other dependencies are kept up to date.

Operating a self-hosted runner comes with [certain security concerns according to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security).
Just like GitHub's runners, the self-hosted runners managed by the charm are isolated in a single-use virtual machine.

Metrics and logs about the runners and the charm itself are collected and sent to the [Canonical Observability Stack](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack) for analysis and visualisation.

The charm enforces a set of GitHub repository settings as best practice. This is planned to be opt-in in the future. See [How to comply with repository policies](https://charmhub.io/github-runner/docs/how-to-repo-policy).

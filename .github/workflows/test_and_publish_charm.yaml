name: Test and publish charm

# On push to a "special" branch, we:
# * always publish to charmhub at latest/edge/branchname
# * always run tests
# where a "special" branch is one of main/master or track/**, as
# by convention these branches are the source for a corresponding
# charmhub edge channel.

## <kbd>function</kbd> `extract`

```python
extract(flavor: str, ignore_runners: set[str]) → None
```

Extract and issue metrics from runners. 

The metrics are extracted from the shared filesystem of given runners and respective metric events are issued. Orphan shared filesystems are cleaned up. 

If corrupt data is found, an error is raised immediately, as this may indicate that a malicious runner is trying to manipulate the shared file system. In order to avoid DoS attacks, the file size is also checked. 



**Args:**
 
 - <b>`flavor`</b>:  The flavor of the runners to extract metrics from. 
 - <b>`ignore_runners`</b>:  The set of runners to ignore. 



**Raises:**
 
 - <b>`CorruptMetricDataError`</b>:  If one of the files inside the shared filesystem is not valid.

## <kbd>class</kbd> `PostJobMetrics`
Metrics for the post-job phase of a runner. 



**Args:**
 
 - <b>`timestamp`</b>:  The UNIX time stamp of the time at which the event was originally issued.

## <kbd>class</kbd> `PreJobMetrics`
Metrics for the pre-job phase of a runner. 



**Args:**
 
 - <b>`timestamp`</b>:  The UNIX time stamp of the time at which the event was originally issued. 
 - <b>`workflow`</b>:  The workflow name. 
 - <b>`workflow_run_id`</b>:  The workflow run id.
